      <title>George Mackay, Femme, Jason Isaacs, Archie &amp; Eileen</title>
      <description>It’s another bumper week for guests: Simon and Mark chat to their fave “gorgeous George” Mackay about his new psychosexual noir ‘Femme’, which sees a man who is targeted in a horrific homophobic attack seek revenge on one of his attackers, played by Mackay. They also say hello to Jason Isaacs, who is here in the studio to chew the fat and discuss his turn as Hollywood legend Cary Grant in the ITV miniseries ‘Archie’.

Mark gives his thoughts on both, along with reviewing ‘Eileen’, an adaptation of Ottessa Moshfegh’s best-selling, psychological-thriller novel about a shy young woman working at a prison when a captivating, glamorous counsellor, played by Anne Hathaway, and helps her access new facets of her personality, but may be drawing her into something more dangerous - Hathaway described it as ‘Carol’ meets ‘Reservoir Dogs’.

      <description>Strap in for a bumper week of interviews: Simon sits down for an entertaining chat with Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby to discuss their turns in Ridley Scott’s new epic, ‘Napoleon’, which looks at the military commander’s origins and ruthless climb to emperor through the prism of his volatile relationship with his wife and one true love, Josephine; and both Simon and Mark talk to Jodie Whittaker about her new Australian-set series ‘One Night’, which follows three friends whose friendship was destroyed by a traumatic event 20 years prior.

Mark gives his thoughts on both, along with reviewing Joanna Hogg’s latest offering, ‘The Eternal Daughter’, a gothic mystery drama, which stars long-time collaborator Tilda Swinton in a double role, playing both a middle-aged filmmaker and her elderly mother who are guests at a mysterious hotel.

      <title>Todd Haynes, May December, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, The Marvels &amp; Saltburn</title>
      <description>Simon meets director Todd Haynes to discuss his thorny, new offering ‘May December’, which stars the powerhouse duo of Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman, and tells the story of a seemingly perfect married couple’s marriage buckling under the pressure when an actress arrives to do research for a film about their notorious tabloid romance twenty years prior.

Mark also weighs in on the film, along with giving his thoughts on ‘The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes’, the latest instalment of the dystopian kids franchise, which sees Rachel Zegler star as a defiant female tribute from the impoverished District 12; ‘The Marvels’, the second instalment for Brie Larson’s titular superhero Captain, which sees Carol Danvers get her powers entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, forcing them to work together to save the universe; and ‘Saltburn’, Emerald Fennell’s class-skewering psychological thriller, which she was on the show to talk about last week.

Plus, Mark and Simon take us through the Box Office Top 10 and the film events worth catching in this week’s What’s On.

      <title>Emerald Fennell, The Automat, Anatomy Of A Fall &amp; Dream Scenario</title>
      <description>Simon sits down with actor-writer-director Emerald Fennell to discuss her new, star-studded, class-skewering, psychological thriller ‘Saltburn’, which sees an Oxford scholarship student drawn into the world of a charming aristocrat when he invites him to his family’s sprawling country estate.  

Mark reviews ‘The Automat’, a Mel Brooks-fronted documentary centered on the vending machine popularised in the 20th Century that offered fresh cooked meals in a commissary-style eatery; ‘Anatomy of a Fall’, the Palme d’Or winning crime thriller about the trial of a woman accused of murdering her husband in their remote chalet in the French Alps; ‘Dream Scenario’, a surreal comedy about a hapless family man, played by Nicolas Cage, who finds his life upended when millions of strangers start seeing him in their dreams.

      <title>Gabriel Byrne, Dance First, How To Have Sex, Bottoms &amp; The Killer </title>
      <description>This week, Simon sits down with the brilliant and always-interesting Gabriel Byrne for a philosophical chat about his turn as the legendary Irish playwright Samuel Beckett in ‘Dance First’, James Marsh’s experimental biographical drama. Their conversation is so good, there’s more of it in Take 2!

Mark also gives his thoughts on the film, as well as reviewing ‘How To Have Sex’, cinematographer-turned director Molly Manning Walker's Cannes-winning feature debut about  a group of teen girls’ rite-of-passage first holiday to Malia; ‘Bottoms’, the Young Hollywood-packed second feature from director Emma Seligman, which follows two unpopular queer high school students as they start a fight club in a bid to have sex before graduation; and ‘The Killer’, David Fincher’s latest offering starring Michael Fassbender as a – you guessed it – contract killer with a growing conscience.

      <title>Thelma Schoonmaker, Peeping Tom, Typist Artist Pirate King, Cat Person &amp; Five Nights at Freddy’s</title>
      <description>This week, certified film royalty is in the studio! Mark and Simon sit down with Martin Scorsese’s legendary film editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, who is here to discuss restoring her late husband director Michael Powell’s equally legendary body of work as part of the iconic filmmaking duo Powell and Pressburger. She also talks about her own work with Scorsese. A must listen!

Mark reviews the restoration of the Powell and Pressburger classic ‘Peeping Tom’, a psychological horror about a filmmaker who murders women and records their dying moments; ‘Typist Artist Pirate King’, director Carol Morley’s warm and sympathetic fictionalised portrait of the late “avant-garde and misunderstood” artist Audrey Amiss; ‘Cat Person’, a darkly comic psychological thriller about a college student who goes on an awkward date with an older man who may be a murderer, based on Kristen Roupenian’s viral New Yorker short story of the same name; and ‘Five Nights at Freddy’s, a supernatural horror inspired by the indie video game of the same name, which sees a troubled security guard menaced by creepy, animatronic, funhouse animals.

<p>Mark reviews the restoration of the Powell and Pressburger classic ‘Peeping Tom’, a psychological horror about a filmmaker who murders women and records their dying moments; ‘Typist Artist Pirate King’, director Carol Morley’s warm and sympathetic fictionalised portrait of the late “avant-garde and misunderstood” artist Audrey Amiss; ‘Cat Person’, a darkly comic psychological thriller about a college student who goes on an awkward date with an older man who may be a murderer, based on Kristen Roupenian’s viral New Yorker short story of the same name; and ‘Five Nights at Freddy’s, a supernatural horror inspired by the indie video game of the same name, which sees a troubled security guard menaced by creepy, animatronic, funhouse animals.</p>
<p>Plus, the duo takes us through the Box Office Top 10 and the film events worth catching in this week’s What’s On.</p>

      <title>Listen Now: Ghost Story</title>
      <description>Tristan Redman is a journalist who doesn’t believe in ghosts. But weird things happened in his teenage bedroom – weirder than normal. When, years later, he discovers subsequent occupants of his family home were haunted by the ghost of a faceless woman, he’s curious. Because by a strange coincidence, it just so happens that the house Tristan grew up in is right next door to a murder scene - where his wife’s great grandmother was killed by two gunshots to the face. Could there be a connection? Tristan decides to investigate and soon finds himself where no son-in-law should ever be: delving deep into his wife’s family history, asking questions no one wants answered. Wondery and Pineapple Street Studios present Ghost Story — a seven-part podcast series about family secrets, overwhelming coincidences and the things that come back to haunt us.

      <title>Laura Linney, The Miracle Club, Blackberry, Silver Dollar Road &amp; The Fall of the House of Usher </title>
      <description>This week, Mark hosts the show alongside Take fave Ben Bailey-Smith. Ben sits down with one of Hollywood’s finest actresses Laura Linney to discuss her sentimental comedy-drama ‘The Miracle Club’, which follows a group of Dublin women in 1960’s Ireland as they embark on a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage to Lourdes.

Mark offers his own thoughts on the film, while also giving his take on ‘Blackberry’, a Glenn Howerton-starring biographical drama about the rise and fall of the world’s first smartphone; ‘Silver Dollar Road’, Raoul Peck’s latest documentary about a Black family’s decades-long legal fight to maintain ownership of their coastal property in North Carolina; and ‘The Fall of the House of Usher’, a Mike Flanagan-helmed Netflix horror miniseries loosely based on the Edgar Allan Poe short story of the same name.

Mark and Ben also take us through the Box Office Top 10 and the film events worth catching in this week’s What’s On.

      <title>Craig Gillespie, Dumb Money, The Creator &amp; Saw X</title>
      <description>This week’s episode sees Simon interview director Craig Gillespie, to discuss his film 'Dumb Money’, which is based on the true story of everyday people who flipped the script on Wall Street and got rich by turning GameStop(!) into the world's hottest company. Mark reviewed this in full last week.

Other films Mark reviews include ‘The Creator’ - set against the backdrop of a war between humans and robots with AI, a former soldier finds a secret weapon, which turns out to be a robot in the form of a child. Plus ‘Saw X’, where John is back; he travels to Mexico for a risky, experimental medical procedure in the hopes of a miracle cure for cancer... only to discover the entire operation is a scam.

Obviously they also cover the Box Office Top 10, plus it’s a bumper episode for What’s On.

      <title>Alice Troughton, The Lesson, Dumb Money &amp; Expend4bles</title>
      <description>More Mark, more Simon, more mindless natter – and some movie reviews for good measure!

This week’s episode sees Simon sit down with director and Take diehard Alice Troughton, who’s in the studio to discuss her film debut ‘The Lesson’, a mystery-thriller about an aspiring young writer who accepts a tutoring position at the estate of his literary idol only to become ensnared in a web of family secrets.

Mark also offers his thoughts on the film, along with reviewing ‘Dumb Money’, Craig Gillespie’s star-studded dramatisation of the David-and-Goliath, real events, which saw a group of savvy Redditors game the stock market, making a mall video game store the world’s hottest company in the process; and ‘Expend4bles’, the fourth instalment of the Stallone and Statham-helmed franchise, which sees the team assigned to stop a terrorist organisation smuggling nuclear warheads that will ignite a conflict between Russia and the US. High-octane indeed.

The Box Office Top 10 and What’s On are covered as usual.

Time Codes (relevant only for the Vanguard - who are ad-free!):

11:36 Dumb Money Review

22:38 Box Office Top Ten

35:29 Alice Troughton Interview

This week’s episode sees Simon sit down with the humble and delightful Timothy Spall, who is in the studio to discuss his new film ‘Bolan’s Shoes’, a melodrama about the enduring legacy of childhood trauma and the deep bonds of sibling love set to the music of the film’s namesake, T-Rex's Mark Bolan.</p>
<p>Our own iconic Mark also offers his thoughts on the film, along with reviewing ‘A Haunting in Venice’, Kenneth Brannagh’s stab at a Poirot murder-mystery, which sees the famous detective investigating a murder while attending a Halloween séance at a haunted palazzo in Venice, and ‘Brother’, a Canadian drama about the sons of Caribbean immigrants dealing with issues of masculinity, identity and family amid the pulsing beat of Toronto’s early hip-hop scene.</p>
<p>The Box Office Top 10 and What’s On are covered as usual.</p>

      <title>Celine Song, Past Lives, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 &amp; The Nun 2</title>
      <description>Mark and Simon are finally back on land, having abandoned their canalboat somewhere near Slough, and, more importantly, Celine Song is in the studio to discuss her soulful debut feature ‘Past Lives’. The film is her directorial debut, and sees two deeply connected childhood friends reunited for one fateful week as they confront destiny, love and the choices that make a life.

Plus, Mark reviews two new sequels, ‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3’, the Portokalos gang’s latest outing directed by lead actress Nia Vardalos; and ‘The Nun 2’, which sees Sister Irene once again come face to face with the demonic force that plagued her four years ago.

The Box Office Top 10 and What’s On are covered as always.

      <title>Ira Sachs, Passages, Antoine Fuqua, The Equalizer 3 &amp; Sound of Freedom</title>
      <description>With Mark and Simon still having the time of their lives at sea, Anna Bogutskaya and Rhianna Dhillon are back to warm their seats with some sizzling, cinematic takes.

Say a prayer to the cinematic powers that be because this week is a bumper week for interviews. Rhianna sits down with not one but two - yes two! - brilliant directors, Antoine Fuqua and Ira Sachs, to talk about their respective new films, ‘The Equalizer 3’, the final outing for Denzel Washington’s violent vigilante Robert McCall, and ‘Passages’, which sees a gay couple’s marriage thrown into crisis when one of them impulsively begins a passionate affair with a young woman. While we don’t have time to include the interviews in their entirety in Take 1, you can listen to the rest of them in Take 2.

Anna jumps in to offer her thoughts on both, as well as reviewing ’Sound of Freedom’, the controversial, Q-Anon and Donald Trump-endorsed, Jim Caviezel-starring action film about a former US government agent who embarks on a mission to rescue children from sex traffickers in Colombia.

      <title>Louis Garrel, Scrapper, The Innocent, Theater Camp </title>
      <description>With Mark deciding he simply hasn’t had enough of the UK’s waterways and heading back out to join Simon, Robbie Collin and James King are stepping in to co-captain The Take podcasting vessel.  

James sits down with the funny and philosophical French writer, director and actor, Louis Garrel, to discuss his latest film ‘The Innocent’, a comedy-heist-come-family-farce that’s far more personal than you’d first think.   

Robbie reviews ‘Scrapper’, a sunny, imaginative kitchen-sink drama starring Harris Dickinson; and ‘Theater Camp’, a Young Hollywood-packed comedy about the eccentric staff of a rundown theatre camp, who band together with the beloved founder’s crypto-bro son in an attempt to keep it afloat. 

All in all, a great week in movie going.

      <title>Harris Dickinson, Strays, Lie With Me &amp; Blue Beetle</title>
      <description>This week sees Mark holding down the fort with fellow professional film watcher Robbie Collin.  



In a special twist, both Mark and Robbie sit down for a brilliant conversation with British-acting-legend-in-the-making Harris Dickinson to discuss his sunny, new, kitchen-sink drama, ‘Scrapper’. 



They also debate the merits of ‘Strays’, an R-rated comedy featuring the voices of Jamie Foxx, Isla Fisher and Will Ferrell, who play a motley crew of stray dogs, who team up to get revenge on one of their owners; ‘Lie With Me’, a thoughtful French film about an author who, on returning to his hometown for the first time in decades, meets the son of his first love; and ‘Blue Beetle’, DC’s latest offering, which sees an alien scarab choose a young, college graduate to be its symbiotic host, bestowing him with a suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers.

        <![CDATA[<p>This week sees Mark holding down the fort with fellow professional film watcher Robbie Collin.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In a special twist, both Mark and Robbie sit down for a brilliant conversation with British-acting-legend-in-the-making Harris Dickinson to discuss his sunny, new, kitchen-sink drama, ‘Scrapper’. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They also debate the merits of ‘Strays’, an R-rated comedy featuring the voices of Jamie Foxx, Isla Fisher and Will Ferrell, who play a motley crew of stray dogs, who team up to get revenge on one of their owners; ‘Lie With Me’, a thoughtful French film about an author who, on returning to his hometown for the first time in decades, meets the son of his first love; and ‘Blue Beetle’, DC’s latest offering, which sees an alien scarab choose a young, college graduate to be its symbiotic host, bestowing him with a suit of armor capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers.  </p>

      <title>Neill Blomkamp, Gran Turismo, Haunted Mansion &amp; Meg 2: The Trench</title>
      <description>With Simon still chugging along on the UK’s glorious waterways, beloved actor and Take fave Sanjeev Bhaskar steps in to chat nonsense – ahem, review films - with Mark.

Sanjeev speaks with director Neill Blomkamp about his new stranger-than-fiction biographical sports drama ‘Gran Turismo’, covering everything from Blomkamp’s motivations for making the film to the challenges of shooting in a moving race car - or as the directors puts it, a “motion sickness, nausea machine”.

Mark offers his thoughts on Blomkamp’s new film, which sees a young man win an opportunity to become a real racing driver because of his prowess playing the Gran Turismo video game.

He also reviews ‘Haunted Mansion’, a star-studded remake of the Eddie Murphy-helmed 2003 supernatural comedy of the same name, which sees Rosario Dawson and Lakeith Stanfield take the spooky baton; and ‘Meg 2: The Trench’, indie director Ben Wheatley’s stab at a sequel for the arguably soon-to-be-cult-classic prehistoric shark franchise.

      <title>Nicole Holofcener, Heartstopper S2, You Hurt My Feelings &amp; Joy Ride</title>
      <description>With Mark and Simon on their rip-roaring canal cruise, this week’s episode sees favorites Rhianna Dhillon and Anna Bogutskaya take the helm of the good Take ship.

Rhianna speaks to writer and director Nicole Holofcener about her new film ‘You Hurt My Feelings’ - her view on drafting the script and how she takes feedback...

Rhianna and Anna also review ‘Heartstopper’ Season 2, a Netflix series about two teens Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) who are in the midst of navigating school and young love; ‘Joy Ride’ an outrageous raunchy comedy starring Ashley Park, directed by Adele Lim; plus ‘You Hurt My Feelings’, where a novelist's long-standing marriage suddenly turns upside down when she overhears her husband give his honest reaction to her latest book.

Rhianna and Anna are subjected to this week’s Laughter Lift, and wade through plenty of Box Office Top 10 correspondence!

      <title>Greta Gerwig, Oppenheimer, Barbie &amp; The Bear</title>
      <description>The humanity in growing old. Mattel's uncomfortable history. The undeniability of Ryan Gosling. This week’s episode sees Simon discuss all things ‘Barbie’, already one of the hottest – and pinkest – films of the year, with its wonderfully thoughtful co-writer and director Greta Gerwig.

And if that’s not enough, Mark reviews the other big-hitter of the summer, ‘Oppenheimer’, Christopher Nolan’s epic biographical thriller about the scientist who developed the atomic bomb; and the second season of ‘The Bear’, Christopher Storer’s dynamic, heart-filled kitchen comedy, which sees the chefs at The Beef prepare to reopen as a high-end restaurant.

      <title>Simon Pegg, Medusa, Squaring the Circle &amp; While We Watched</title>
      <description>The terror of wondering whether Tom Cruise has died. Writing the rulebook for shooting in a pandemic. The artistic mediocrity of AI. Even more Tom Cruise! This week’s episode sees Simon sit down for a chat with another iconic Simon, the brilliant Simon Pegg, who has once again strapped on his harness to join the Mission Impossible crew for its seventh stunt-filled, death-defying outing.

Mark reviews ‘Medusa’, a drama about a young woman who leads a vigilante girl gang enforcing Christian standards in Brazil; ‘Squaring the Circle’, a documentary about the creative team responsible for some of the most iconic album artwork of all time; and ‘While We Watched’, a turbulent newsroom documentary that intimately chronicles the working life of broadcast journalist Ravish Kumar, who risks his life to tell the truth about India today.

      <title>James Mangold, Indiana Jones &amp; La Syndicaliste</title>
      <description>‘Phoebe Waller-Bridge is a modern creative force’ who keeps Harrison Ford on his toes, according to director James Mangold, who has just directed the fifth film in the Indiana Jones franchise, ‘Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny’.

Mark reviews ‘Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny’, plus Isabelle Huppert’s new French thriller ‘La Syndicaliste’ and this week’s Box Office Top 10, in a slightly shorter than usual episode, as Mayo has to catch a plane.

      <title>Aisling Bea &amp; Lara McDonnell, No Hard Feelings, Nimona &amp; Asteroid City</title>
      <description>Work experience with Kenneth Branagh. A guardian angel dance troupe. The Simon Mayo cameo that could have been. This week’s episode features an interview with Aisling Bea and Lara McDonnell, who star as the younger and older iterations of the lead character in ‘Greatest Days’, a jukebox musical featuring the hits of Take That.

Mark reviews ‘No Hard Feelings’, Jennifer Lawrence’s new, R-rated, coming-of-age sex comedy; ‘Nimona’, a computer-animated fantasy featuring the voices of Riz Ahmed and Chloë Grace Moretz, which sees a knight and a scrappy shapeshifting teen team up to prove the former’s innocence after he is accused of a crime he did not commit; and ‘Asteroid City’, Wes Anderson’s latest star-studded outing set at a stargazing convention in a retro-futuristic version of 1955.

Mark reviews ‘No Hard Feelings’, Jennifer Lawrence’s new, R-rated, coming-of-age sex comedy; ‘Nimona’, a computer-animated fantasy featuring the voices of Riz Ahmed and Chloë Grace Moretz, which sees a knight and a scrappy shapeshifting teen team up to prove the former’s innocence after he is accused of a crime he did not commit; and ‘Asteroid City’, Wes Anderson’s latest star-studded outing set at a stargazing convention in a retro-futuristic version of 1955.

      <title>Emily Watson, God’s Creatures, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Law of Tehran</title>
      <description>Emily Watson stars alongside Paul Mescal in new psychological drama ‘God’s Creatures’. She joins Simon and Mark in the studio to talk about what it was like playing Paul’s mother in the film where her sense of right or wrong is well and truly put to the test.

Mark reviews new Iranian crime movie ‘Law of Tehran’, ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves’ - starring a stellar cast including Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, and Regé-Jean Page among others - based on the tabletop role-playing game ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’, and ‘God’s Creatures’ - a story about a mother (played by Emily Watson) who tells a lie for her beloved son that rips apart their family and close-knit Irish town.

      <title>Daveed Diggs, Pearl, Rye Lane, Shazam! Fury of the Gods, 80 for Brady &amp; Extrapolations</title>
      <description>The Multifaceted Daveed Diggs tells Simon how his role as Marshall Zucker in the start studded ‘Extrapolations’ was deeply personal.

Mark reviews South London rom- com ‘Rye Lane’ - starring David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah, ‘Pearl’ Ti West’s prequal to horror film ‘X’ which sees Mia Goth reprise her role as the title character, ‘80 for Brady’- which is a comedy starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Sally Field, and Rita Moreno and is inspired by the true story of four best friends who travel to the Superbowl to see their hero Tom Brady, ‘Extrapolations’ Apple +’s new anthology drama, set in the near future where the effects of climate change have become embedded in everyday life, and last but not least ‘Shazam! Fury of the Gods’ - which once again follows teen Billy Batson as he transforms into his adult superhero alter ego.

      <title>Introducing... Please Tell Me A Story</title>
      <description>Omid tells his story to Abi. Abi tells Omid’s story to Sean, then Sean to Kai, Kai to Sikisa and Sikisa to Helen… each time with hilarious misrememberings, improvisations, stumbles, fumbles and laughs.

Six comedians have a funny story to tell. Can they pass the story along the chain without completely twisting the tale? But this isn’t like the game you play at school where you only whisper short sentences. Each episode is a complete, beautifully written story, with each retelling getting funnier (and weirder!) as it passes on.

And boy, does season one of Please Tell Me A Story feature an all star comedy cast: Omid Djalili, Abi Clarke, Seán Burke, Kai Samra, Sikisa, and Helen Bauer.

Join them as the story gets weird…https://listen.sonymusic-podcasts.link/qxhC1Drl

      <title>Gary Oldman, Slow Horses, White Noise, Nil By Mouth, Tori &amp; Lokita, &amp; Violent Night</title>
      <description>Why eating nineteen bowls of noodles helped Gary Oldman get into character for Jackson Lamb – he joins Mark and Simon in the studio, fully in character for ‘Slow Horses season two’. Gary talks filming the new series, as well as the 25th anniversary of ‘Nil by Mouth.’

Mark reviews ‘White Noise’- an apocalyptic black comedy directed by Noah Baumbach and starring Greta Gerwig, Adam Driver and Don Cheadle, ‘Tori &amp; Lokita,’ which tells the tale of two youngsters who are united by their shared experience of travelling  alone from Africa and having to contend with the cruel conditions of their exile in Belgium, the 1997 cult classic ‘Nil By Mouth’ which has been re-released by the BFI  for its 25th anniversary - written and directed by Gary Oldman, and ‘Violent Night’ - a new Christmas horror comedy – where Santa Claus is called in to rescue a wealthy family from a group of mercenaries.
