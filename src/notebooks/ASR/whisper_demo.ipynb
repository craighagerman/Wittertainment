I got it. Okay. Anyway. Here's another science you want for you I was out at a pub with rooms in showbiz north slendon on Saturday for a wedding reception a neutron walked in How much for a pint? He said for you no charge said the barman and I get that as well because in neutron has no charge Cyber atomic particle with no charge and then a photon walked in. I'd like a room for the night. Please. He said Certainly do you have any luggage we can take up to the room ask the receptionist no said the photon. I'm traveling light Because the photon is like a little like particle quantum of light In it was in fact it's an education today.

Hey Mark, seeing as you loved the noble gases joke so much last week, I was going to tell you another one, but all the good ones are gone. I got that, I got that, because argon's a gas. It is, it's a noble gas. I got it, okay. Anyway, here's another science you want for you, are you ready? I was out at a pub with rooms in Chobhub's North London on Saturday for a wedding reception. A neutron walked in. How much for a pint, he said. For you, no charge, said the barman. And I get that as well, because a neutron has no charge. Subatomic particle with no charge. And then a photon walked in. I'd like a room for the night, please, he said. Certainly, do you have any luggage we can take up to the room? Asked the receptionist. No, said the photon. I'm traveling light. Because a photon is a... It is a light particle. Quantum of light. It was in fact... It's an education today. It's not funny, but it's an education. It was in fact cousin Cecil's wedding to his delightful Parisian fiancee Noémie on Saturday. At the reception, I raised my champagne glass and said, A dish of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and often milk or cream, then pan fried. Alternative names and variants include eggy bread, Bombay toast, gypsy toast, and poor nights of Windsor. It was a French toast. The evening did not end well. I got the bar bill and had a massive row with the bar staff. I argued with my cashier that the bill was £70.20, not £7,000... £7,020. He didn't get the point. Anyway, what have we got? You've got that as well. Yes. Yes, got that. What's still to come? Dungeons and Dragons. Okay, Vanguard Division. Unless you're a Vanguard Easter, in which case you definitely don't have a nickname that everyone else knows apart from you and your service will not be interrupted.

    "`base` model is not satisfactory. The punctuation and sentences are problematic and a number of words are wrong.\n",
    "`medium` model is much much better. It seems to have correct sentences/punctuation. Most of the problems in `base` are resolved. It even got the French name Noémie correct. One thing `medium` got wrong that `base` got right was \"showbiz north London\" as opposed to \"Chobhub north London\". Another thing `medium` got wrong was \"Vanguard Easter\" instead of \"vanguardista\". But this isn't a common term so is forgivable. I think both of these examples (and other Wittertainment jargon) could be improved with model fine-tuning."
