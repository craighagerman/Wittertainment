Hey, Mark, seeing as you love the noble gases joke so much last week, I was going to tell you another one, but all the good ones are gone. I got that. I got that because argon's a gas. It is. It's a gas. I got it. Okay. Anyway, here's another science you want for you. Are you ready? I was out at a pub with rooms in Showbiz, North London on Saturday for a wedding reception. A neutron walked in. How much for a pint, he said. For you, no charge, said the barman. And I get that as well because a neutron has no charge. Subatomic particle with no charge. And then a photon walked in. I'd like a room for the night, please, he said. Certainly. Do you have any luggage we can take up to the room? Asked the receptionist. No, said the photon. I'm traveling light. Because a photon is literally a... It is a light particle. Particle of light. It was in fact... It's an education today. Definitely. It's not funny, but it's an education. It was in fact cousin Cecil's wedding to his delightful Parisian fiancée Noémie on Saturday. At the reception, I raised my champagne glass and said, a dish of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and often milk or cream, then pan fried. Alternative names and variants include eggy bread, Bombay toast, gypsy toast and poor Knights of Windsor. It was a French toast. The evening did not end well. I got the bar bill and had a massive row with the bar stuff. I argued with my cashier that the bill was £70.20, not £7,020. He didn't get the point. Anyway, what have we got? He got that as well. Yes. Yes, got that. What's still to come? Dungeons and Dragons. Okay. Dungeons and Dragons. Unless you're a vanguardista, in which case you definitely don't have a nickname that everyone else knows apart from you and your service will not be interrupted. Thanks very much for watching this video. Hope you enjoyed watching it as much as we enjoyed making it. While you're here, check out all the other videos because they're cool too, aren't they? Yeah.
