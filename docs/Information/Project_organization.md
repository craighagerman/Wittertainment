# On Project Organization

I've had a long term struggle with how to best organize directories, code, files, experiments, research note etc for a data science project. Should research notes be together with code or not? What about data? Data might be used across projects - better to store outside of project directory?

I was pleased to discover Cookiecutter Data Science [https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/] and see that other people had also thought through the same issues. This project isn't a purely data science project, but I intend to start with the cookiecutter DS organization and diverge organtically as appropriate.
