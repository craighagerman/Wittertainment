# Done

## The Plan
- notes on vision and initial plan


## Commitizen
- setup commitizen to use with the project. Purpose:
  - enforce Conventional Commits
  - Auto Semantic Versioning (with `cz bump`)
  - Auto CHANGELOG.md (with `cz bump`)

## Pre-Commit hooks
- set up `pre-commit-config.yaml`
- initial: just to add commitizen as a pre-commit hook
- TODO: set up black, Ruff etc for python, whatever is needed for JS etc
  - I know how to use pre-commit hooks for just python, but haven't used for multi-langage mono-repo before.

## Gitignore
- set up gitignore for python
- added VSCode & IntelliJ ignores
- TODO: figure out what to add for other languages/tech (JS, docker etc)
